## React Tutorial - Tic-Tac-Toe Game Dockerized

Here is the final result of the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) ready to be run. The objective: speed up the process of creating Dockerized React apps.

As you see, I have just added a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file. That's it!

Make sure you've got Docker installed already, and run:

    git clone https://github.com/programarivm/react-tutorial-dockerized.git
    cd react-tutorial-dockerized
    npm install
    docker-compose up
